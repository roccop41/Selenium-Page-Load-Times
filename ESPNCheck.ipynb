    "## ESPN Subpages Load Time Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initializes the WebDriver as Chrome with options and capabilities**\n",
    "   - Sets up the WebDriver to interact with the Chrome browser using specified options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defines the base URL and subpages to measure**\n",
    "   - Lists the subpages of ESPN's website for load time measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measures the page load time for each subpage**\n",
    "   - Records the time taken to load each subpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stores the load times in a dictionary**\n",
    "   - Organizes the load time data for each subpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prints the load times for each subpage**\n",
    "   - Outputs the load times for easy viewing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety Concerns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No data modification on the website, only read and log**\n",
    "   - Ensures the script only reads and logs data without making any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Safe to run the script on the website without risk of altering content or changing network requests**\n",
    "   - Confirms that the script’s operations do not interfere with the website’s functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Read-Only actions when exploring the subpages**\n",
    "   - Guarantees that all actions performed by the script are read-only, preventing any unintended modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installs Required:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pip install selenium`\n",
    "- `pip install webdriver-manager`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensure that the ChromeDriver version matches your installed Chrome browser version**\n",
    "   - Compatibility between ChromeDriver and the Chrome browser version is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpful Links:**\n",
